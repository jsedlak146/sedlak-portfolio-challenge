# sedlak-portfolio-challenge

## Description

The challenge for this week asked us to create a portfolio to showcase our information and work.  I refactored from the previous website we used and added a few of my own touches to complete the website.  Below are my links to the GitHub repo and to the finished website.

## Installation

I took out the unnecessary CSS and HTML elements, like the aside bar.  After this was finished, I went in and reworked the code to my needs.

## Usage

To use my portfolio website, utilize the nav bar up at the top.  To view my personl information, click on "About Me" in the top right corner.  If you are interested in viewing my portfolio, please click on "My Portfolio".  Finally, if you click on "Contact Info", you will be directed to the bottom of the webpage, where you can send me an email, and also view my Github and LinkedIn pages.
